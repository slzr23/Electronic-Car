# Electronic Car
Readme (EN)

Electronic Car is a project realized by a group of students from Sainte Marie high school in Caen, France. 

Based on the programming of a esp32 card, Electronic Car is a complete automated car that can be controlled by phone with a simple web browser. The project was entirely realized in Python3.

In terms of hardware, our ESP32 is connected by wire to two motors (Joy-it com-Motor01) that have wheels and can easily move the car forward and backward. 
The board is powered by a conventional external battery which is connected by a micro usb cable to the board. The motors receive the signal from the board and are powered by a box with a 9V battery. The two motors with wheels are located at the back of the car, and for easier steering we chose to attach a swivel wheel that can go in all directions to the front of the car. Finally, we made a body with a 3D printer to cover the whole. (You can see the result on the file: "voiture.png" and the 3D SketchUp file "Mod√®le coque electronic car.skp") 

If you want more information about the car, and also see what it can do, you can go on our website : (https://slzr23.github.io/Electronic_Car/), you can also see a result in the file "results.mp4".
The source code of this site is also on this repository in the "presentation" folder.
